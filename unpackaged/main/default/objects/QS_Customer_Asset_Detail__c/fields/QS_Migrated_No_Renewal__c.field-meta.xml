    <description>Created for situations where Contracts are migrated into Salesforce and no Subscriptions under the Contract will renew. This formula is set based on a Contract field that indicates there will never be a renewal opportunity on the Contract. If this field is true, then active CATs where the end date has passed will not update to Pending Renewal; instead they will go to Expired. If we did not allow for this option, non-renewing CATs would remain stuck at Pending Renewal statusâ€”waiting for a renewal opportunity that will never be created.</description>
